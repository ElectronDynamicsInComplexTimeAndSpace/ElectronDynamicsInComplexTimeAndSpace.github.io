This repository contains supplementary information for the thesis

> *Electron Dynamics in Complex Time and Complex Space*. E. Pisanty, Imperial College London, 2016.

It is essentially identical to the supplementary information of the paper

> *Slalom in complex time: emergence of low-energy structures in tunnel ionization via complex time contours*. E. Pisanty and M. Ivanov. [*Phys. Rev. A* **93**, 043408 (2016)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.93.043408) [arXiv:1507.00011](http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.00011).

which can be seen [here][1] and is available as a repository [here][2]. It is reprinted here simply to keep things well labelled. This supplementary material can be accessed in either of three ways:

 [1]: https://SlalomInComplexTime.github.io
 [2]: https://github.com/SlalomInComplexTime/SlalomInComplexTime.github.io

 - You can view it on your browser online, at [https://ElectronDynamicsInComplexTimeAndSpace.github.io][3] (recommended).
 - You can download it from [this zip file][4] and open it locally. To do this, download the zip file, extract its contents to a single directory, and open the file `SupplementaryInformation.html` in your browser.
