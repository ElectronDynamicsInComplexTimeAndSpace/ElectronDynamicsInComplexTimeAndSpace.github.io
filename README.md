This repository contains supplementary information for the thesis

> *Electron Dynamics in Complex Time and Complex Space*. E. Pisanty, Imperial College London, 2016.

It is essentially identical to the supplementary information of the paper

> *Slalom in complex time: emergence of low-energy structures in tunnel ionization via complex time contours*. E. Pisanty and M. Ivanov. [*Phys. Rev. A* **93**, 043408 (2016)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.93.043408) [arXiv:1507.00011](http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.00011).

It is reprinted here simply to keep things well labelled. This supplementary material can be accessed in either of three ways:
